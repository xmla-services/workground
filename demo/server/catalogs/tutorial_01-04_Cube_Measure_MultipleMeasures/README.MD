## Schemas:
### Schema Minimal_Cubes_With_Measures : 

		
		A minimal cube with two measures from different table columns
		
		A data cube can contain multiple measures and they can be taken from different columns of the database fact table. 
		Each measure must be defined by a separate <Measure> tag, in which the column attribute is used to assign the database table colum that holds the measure's data.
		All measures of the cube belong to a default cube dimension called "Measures", which can be adressed within the schema (e.g while adding a calculated measure).
		
		This sample cube contains the two measures "Measure 1", which traces back to the table column "VALUE1", and Measure2", which is derived from the table column "VALUE2".
