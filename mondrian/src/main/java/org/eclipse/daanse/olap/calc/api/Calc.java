/**
 * <code>Calc</code> is the base class for all calculable expressions.
 *
 * <h3>Logical and physical expression languages</h3>
 *
 * Mondrian has two expression languages:<ul>
 * <li>The logical language of parsed MDX fragments ({@link mondrian.olap.Exp}).
 * <li>The phyiscal language of compiled expressions ({@link Calc}).
 * </ul></p>
 *
 * The two languages allow us to separate logical (how an
 * MDX expression was specified) from physical (how it is to be evaluated).
 * The physical language is more strongly typed, and certain constructs which
 * are implicit in the logical language (such as the addition of calls
 * to the <code>&lt;Member&gt;.CurrentMember</code> function) are made
 * explicit in the physical language.<p/>
 *
 * <h3>Compilation</h3>
 *
 * Expressions are generally created from using an expression compiler
 * ({@link ExpCompiler}). There are often more than one evaluation strategy
 * for a given expression, and compilation process gives us an opportunity to
 * choose the optimal one.<p/>

     *
     * Some examples:<ul>
     *
     * <li>The expression
     * <blockquote><code>[Measures].[Unit Sales]</code></blockquote>
     * depends on all dimensions except <code>[Measures]</code>.
     *
     * <li>The boolean expression
     * <blockquote><code>([Measures].[Unit Sales],
     * [Time].[1997]) &gt; 1000</code></blockquote>
     * depends on all hierarchies except [Measures] and [Time].
     *
     * <li>The list expression
     * <blockquote><code>Filter([Store].[USA].Children,
     * [Measures].[Unit Sales] &lt; 50)</code></pre></blockquote>
     * depends upon all hierarchies <em>except</em> [Store] and [Measures].
     * How so? Normally the scalar expression would depend upon all hierarchies
     * except [Measures], but the <code>Filter</code> function sets the [Store]
     * context before evaluating the scalar expression, so it is not inherited
     * from the surrounding context.
