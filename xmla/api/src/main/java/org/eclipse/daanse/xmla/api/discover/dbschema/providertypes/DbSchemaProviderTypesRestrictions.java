     *@return This enumeration is the same as LEVEL_DBTYPE
     *for MDSCHEMA_LEVELS.
     *The type of the member key
     *column that is used for the
     *level attribute. It MUST be
     *null if concatenated keys are
     *used as the member key
     *column.
     *Type values are described in
     *the following list:
     *0 – (DBTYPE_EMPTY)
     *Indicates that no value
     *was specified.
     *2 – (DBTYPE_I2)
     *Indicates a two-byte
     *signed integer.
     *3 – (DBTYPE_I4)
     *Indicates a four-byte
     *signed integer.
     *4 – (DBTYPE_R4)
     *Indicates a single-
     *precision floating-point
     *value.
     *5 – (DBTYPE_R8)
     *Indicates a double-
     *precision floating-point
     *value.
     *6 – (DBTYPE_CY)
     *Indicates a currency
     *value. Currency is a
     *fixed-point number with
     *four digits to the right of
     *the decimal point and is
     *stored in an eight-byte
     *signed integer scaled by
     *10,000.
     *7 – (DBTYPE_DATE)
     *Indicates a date value.
     *Date values are stored as
     *Double, the whole part
     *of which is the number of
     *days since December 30,
     *1899, and the fractional
     *part of which is the
     *fraction of a day.
     *8 – (DBTYPE_BSTR) A
     *pointer to a BSTR, which
     *is a null-terminated
     *character string in which
     *the string length is stored
     *with the string.
     *9 – (DBTYPE_IDISPATCH)
     *Indicates a pointer to an
     *IDispatch interface on an
     *OLE object.
     *10 – (DBTYPE_ERROR)
     *Indicates a 32-bit error
     *code.
     *11 – (DBTYPE_BOOL)
     *Indicates a Boolean
     *value.

     *IUnknown interface on an
     *OLE object.
     *14 – (DBTYPE_DECIMAL)
     *Indicates an exact
     *numeric value with a
     *fixed precision and scale.
     *The scale is between 0
     *and 28.
     *16 – (DBTYPE_I1)
     *Indicates a one-byte
     *signed integer.
     *17 – (DBTYPE_UI1)
     *Indicates a one-byte
     *unsigned integer.
     *18 – (DBTYPE_UI2)
     *Indicates a two-byte
     *unsigned integer.
     *19 – (DBTYPE_UI4)
     *Indicates a four-byte
     *unsigned integer.
     *20 – (DBTYPE_I8)
     *Indicates an eight-byte
     *signed integer.
     *21 – (DBTYPE_UI8)

     *The scale is between 0
     *and 38.
     *132 – (DBTYPE_UDT)
     *Indicates a user-defined
     *variable.
     *133 – (DBTYPE_DBDATE)
     *Indicates a date value
     *(yyyymmdd).
